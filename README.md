# Hi, I’m Betty 👋

I recently completed my MSc in Artificial Intelligence & Data Science.

I enjoy working with real-world datasets, particularly where careful data preparation and structured analysis make a real difference. I’m interested in building clean, reproducible workflows and using SQL and Python to turn raw data into clear, interpretable insights.

My recent work focuses on:
- SQL and PostgreSQL analytics
- Data transformation and ETL workflows
- Structured aggregation and window functions
- Time-series modelling and applied forecasting

---

## Recent Work

- NHS prescribing data analysis using PostgreSQL (ICB-level aggregation, cost metrics, outlier detection)
- Time-series forecasting of UK cattle disease trends (MSc dissertation)
- Developing well-documented, reproducible analytics projects

---

## Technical Skills

**Languages**
- SQL (PostgreSQL)
- Python (pandas, modelling workflows)

**Analytics**
- Aggregation and transformation
- Window functions (`LAG`, grouped metrics)
- Feature engineering
- Statistical evaluation

**Workflow**
- Git
- Structured project organisation
- Clear documentation and reproducibility
